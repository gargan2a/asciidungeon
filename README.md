**ASCII Dungeon** is a lightweight terminal-based windows 10 only dungeon crawler written in C++.  
It features turn-based combat, a scaling difficulty system, and classic ASCII-style visuals.

## 🎯 Goal of the Game
Survive and grow stronger as you descend through the dungeon.  
Your ultimate goal is to **defeat the Boss**, who appears on the **100th turn**.  
Every **10 turns**, a **MiniBoss** spawns — each stronger than the last.  
Enemies scale in power as time passes, so careful upgrading and resource management are key.

## ⚔️ Gameplay Overview

- Earn **gold** from victories to upgrade your character.  
- Visit the **Merchant's Shop** to heal or improve your stats.
